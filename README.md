# Snotra
Snotra (pronounced "snow-trah‚Äù ) is a pure Python Cloud (AWS) Auditing Tool it uses boto3 to audit your AWS account against a list of common issues and compliance standards including the CIS benchmark. Snotra produces a results.json file that can be easily incorporated into existing reporting workflows.

## requirements
* Python3
* boto3

## permissions
The following AWS Managed Policies can be attached to the principal in order to grant the access keys the necessary permissions:
* ReadOnlyAccess
* SecurityAudit

## docker
from the cloned repo directory, run:

`docker build -t snotra .`

`docker run --rm -ti -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws/ snotra`

## usage
run audit using default aws profile

`$ python3 snotra.py --results-dir ./snotra/`

run audit with named profile

`$ python3 snotra.py --results-dir ./snotra/ --profile prod_web`


## checks
### CIS Benchmark v1.4.0

## results JSON
The results JSON file that Snotra produces is in the following format:
```
{
    "account" : account_id,                     # account ID e.g. 123456789123
    "user" : user_arn,                          # ARN of user used to run test e.g. arn:aws:iam::123456789123:user/shaun
    "datetime" : datetime.today(),              # datetime of scan e.g. 2021-09-11 13:14:34.562040
    "findings" : [
        {                                       # each check function returns a results dictionary in this format
            "id": id,                           # finding ID e.g "iam_3" (string)
            "ref": ref,                         # finding reference CIS etc e.g "2.3.1" (string)

### checks
All checks are a function/method of the relevent class and are in the following format:

```
    def service_n(self):
        # name of check
        
        results = {
            "id" : "service_n",
            "ref" : "n/a",
            "compliance" : "n/a",
            "level" : "n/a",
            "service" : "service",
            "name" : "name of check",
            "affected": [],
            "analysis" : "",
            "description" : "this is a check template",
            "remediation" : "hack all the things",
            "impact" : "info",
            "probability" : "info",
            "cvss_vector" : "n/a",
            "cvss_score" : "n/a",
            "pass_fail" : ""
        }

        logging.info(results["name"])

        # actual check logic here

        return results
```

All methods contain the results dictionary object, print the name of the check on start up and retun the results dict after completing the check logic and populating it (affected, analysis and pass_fail) with the results of the check.
