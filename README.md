Snotra
======
Snotra (pronounced "snow-trah‚Äù ) is a pure Python Cloud (AWS and Azure) Auditing Tool whihc will check your accounts against a list of common issues and compliance standards including the CIS benchmark. Snotra produces a results.json file that can be easily incorporated into existing reporting workflows.

AWS is on the main branch, Azure is on this branch.

permissions
===========
The user account or service principal will need to have the "reader" role in Azure RBAC at the subscription level.

usage
=====

authentication
--------------
Snotra uses the DefaultAzureCredential() to authenticate and will handle most authentication scenarios including CLI, Powershell and Environmentvariables. 


service principal (environment vars)::

    export AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant_id>
    export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<client_id)
    export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret_value>

cli::

    az login

scan
----
full scan::

    python3 snotra.py -r <results_dir> -t <tenant_id>

results JSON
============
The results JSON file that Snotra produces is in the following format:
```
{
    "account" : account_id,                     # account ID e.g. 123456789123
    "user" : user_arn,                          # ARN of user used to run test e.g. arn:aws:iam::123456789123:user/shaun
    "datetime" : datetime.today(),              # datetime of scan e.g. 2021-09-11 13:14:34.562040
    "findings" : [
        {                                       # each check function returns a results dictionary in this format
            "id": id,                           # finding ID e.g "iam_3" (string)
            "ref": ref,                         # finding reference CIS etc e.g "2.3.1" (string)

            "analysis": analysis,               # technical analysis e.g. "AWS config is not enabled in eu-west-1" (string)
            "description": description,         # description of issue e.g. "AWS Config is a web service that performs ..." (string)
            "remediation": remediation,         # remediation advice e.g. "enable AWS Config in all regions" (string)
            "impact": impact,                   # impact rating (high|medium|low|info) e.g. "medium" (string)
            "probability": probability,         # probably rating (high|medium|low|info) e.g. "low" (string)
            "cvss_vector": cvss_vector,         # CVSS v3 vector e.g "AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N" (string)

checks
------
All checks are a function/method of the relevent class and are in the following format:

```
    def service_n(self):
        # name of check
        
        results = {
            "id" : "service_n",
            "ref" : "n/a",
            "compliance" : "n/a",
            "level" : "n/a",
            "service" : "service",
            "name" : "name of check",
            "affected": [],
            "analysis" : "",
            "description" : "this is a check template",
            "remediation" : "hack all the things",
            "impact" : "info",
            "probability" : "info",
            "cvss_vector" : "n/a",
            "cvss_score" : "n/a",
            "pass_fail" : ""
        }

        logging.info(results["name"])

        # actual check logic here

        return results
```

All methods contain the results dictionary object, print the name of the check on start up and retun the results dict after completing the check logic and populating it (affected, analysis and pass_fail) with the results of the check.
