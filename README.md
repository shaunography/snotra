# Snotra
Snotra (pronounced "snow-trah‚Äù ) is a pure Python Cloud (AWS) Auditing Tool it uses boto3 to audit your AWS account against a list of common issues and compliance standards including the CIS benchmark. Snotra produces a results.json file that can be easily incorporated into existing reporting workflows.

## requirements
* Python3
* boto3

## permissions
The following AWS Managed Policies can be attached to the principal in order to grant the access keys the necessary permissions:
* ReadOnlyAccess
* ViewOnlyAccess
* SecurityAudit

## docker
from the cloned repo directory, run:

`docker build -t snotra .`

`docker run --rm -ti -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws/ snotra`

## usage
run full audit using default aws profile

`$ python3 snotra.py --results-dir ./snotra/`

run full audit with named profile

`$ python3 snotra.py --results-dir ./snotra/ --profile prod_web`

run CIS only audit with named profile

`$ python3 snotra.py --results-dir ./snotra/ --profile prod_web --cis`

## Lambda
It is also possible to deploy Snotra as a Lambda Function, see the following blog post for more info.

## results JSON

## contributions
### code
Pull requests, bug reports and enhancement suggestions are more than welcome.

### checks
All checks are a function/method of the relevent class and are in the following format:

```
    def service_n(self):
        # name of check
        
        results = {
            "id" : "service_n",
            "ref" : "n/a",
            "compliance" : "n/a",
            "level" : "n/a",
            "service" : "service",
            "name" : "name of check",
            "affected": [],
            "analysis" : "",
            "description" : "this is a check template",
            "remediation" : "hack all the things",
            "impact" : "info",
            "probability" : "info",
            "cvss_vector" : "n/a",
            "cvss_score" : "n/a",
            "pass_fail" : ""
        }

        logging.info(results["name"])

        # actual check logic here

        return results
```

All methods contain the results dictionary object, print the name of the check on start up and retun the results dict after completing the check logic and populating it (affected, analysis and pass_fail) with the results of the check.
