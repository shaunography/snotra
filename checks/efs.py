You specify the backup frequency, when to back up, how long to retain backups, and a lifecycle policy for backups.\n- Restore backups of Amazon EFS data. You can restore file system data to either a new or existing file system. You also can choose whether to perform a full restore or an item-level restore.\n\nFile systems that you create using the Amazon EFS console are automatically backed up by AWS Backup by default. You can turn on automatic backups after creating your EFS file system using the AWS CLI or API. The default EFS backup plan uses the AWS Backup recommended settings for automatic backupsâ€”daily backups with a 35-day retention period. The backups created using the default EFS backup plan are stored in a default EFS backup vault, which is also created by Amazon EFS on your behalf. The default backup plan and backup vault cannot be deleted.\nAll data in an EFS file system is backed up, whatever storage class the data is in. You don't incur data access charges when backing up an EFS file system that has lifecycle management enabled and has data in the Infrequent Access (IA) or Archive storage class. When you restore a recovery point, all files are restored to the Standard storage class.",
