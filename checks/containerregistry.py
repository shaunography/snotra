You can limit access to the API server endpoint using authorized IP ranges. You can also create a fully private cluster to limit API server access to your virtual network. You can control access to the API server using Kubernetes role-based access control (Kubernetes RBAC) and Azure RBAC.\nAlthough protected with authentication to minimise the attack Surface of your account and provide greater defence in depth it is recommended to either use a private clusters that only permit access from internal Azure Virtual Networks and or configure a set of authorized IP ranges following the principle of least privilege and only allow access from trusted networks and IP addresses.",
